An improved coupling assembly is disclosed for use in bulk material conveying systems. The coupling assembly includes a first tubular section having an annular flange. The assembly receives an endless rope assembly with spaced disks for moving bulk material including powdered, pelletized, and granulated material. A second tubular section has a portion  into the first tubular section secured with first and second coupling members including a section overlying and engaging a portion of the second tubular section. A first flange section is disclosed which mates with a laterally projecting flange section of the first tubular section and a second flange section. Sealing elements for sealing the assembly from the escape of fluidizing gasses are disposed between the first flange sections of the coupling members and the laterally projecting flange portion of the first tubular section and between the first and second tubular sections.  and radial forces applied to the sealing elements when coupling members are secured to the tubular sections provide a fluid tight seal.
