An authentication system authenticates a mobile communication system each time it attempts to register or communication in a mobile satellite system. The authentication system stores a first security key to establish communication in the mobile communication network system. The system generates a second security key having first and second components using a first process having first and second input signals. The first input signal includes the first security key, and the second input signal includes at least  of a transmit frequency and a receive frequency. The system generates a third security key using a second process having third and fourth input signals. The third input signal includes the second component of the second security key and the fourth input signal is a random number. Advantageously, the system verifies that the mobile communication system is authorized to establish communication using at least  of the first, second, third and fourth components of the second and third security keys. This  procedure is difficult to circumvent, thereby preventing unauthorized use of the mobile satellite system.
