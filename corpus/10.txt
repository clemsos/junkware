An electric rotary tying device system used for tying fishing flies that provides an in-line rotational drive system contained in a rotatably, elevationally and angularly adjustable main housing. Fully adjustable gripping means are non-destructive and are used to tie regular fishing flies while a modified gripping means allows the tying of tube flies. A fully reversible, bi-directional, variable speed, low voltage drive means and rotatable in-line drive system is controlled by a variable speed foot switch to provide variable rotation to the gripping means. The foot operated control switch frees both hands when tying a fishing fly thereby providing greater control over the precise positioning and tensional wrapping of fly tying material. A plurality of accessory bores and a movable mounting member provide attachment points for various accessories.
