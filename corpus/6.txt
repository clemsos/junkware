A semiconductor acceleration sensor for detecting accelerations applied in  orthogonal directions includes a semiconductor body having a peripheral frame, a central weight disposed within the peripheral frame, and first and second beams  from and connecting the peripheral frame and the weight. At least  piezoresistors are disposed on each of the first and second beams and are electrically connected in first and second bridge circuits. Each bridge circuit includes  piezoresistors from each of the  beams so that accelerations applied perpendicular and parallel to the semiconductor body can be individually detected with a single semiconductor acceleration sensor.
