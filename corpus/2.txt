A chemiluminescent composition comprising an  component comprising polystyrene or homopoly-.alpha.-methylstyrene containing an  ester; an activator component comprising a solution of a  compound and a catalyst in a first solvent; and a fluorescer contained in the  component, activator component, or in both the  component and the activator component. The first solvent is preferably a propylene glycol dialkyl ether. The chemiluminescent composition, when activated, permits light to be produced of controllable duration.
