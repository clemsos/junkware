An adjustable valve to control the amount of water flowing through the refill water hose to the overflow tube and into the water closet bowl. The valve is a dual component device including a housing structure and a lever component. Both the housing structure and lever component have a trunk section of similar shape, but of different size. The trunk section of the lever component fits snugly within the trunk section of the housing structure. The lever component is able to rotate within the housing structure. The trunk sections in both the housing structure and the lever component include openings which provide a passageway for water to flow therethrough. The openings in the housing structure are spherically shaped and the openings in the lever component are pear-shaped. The housing structure includes a pair of tabs disposed .degree. from  another for limiting the rotation of the lever component such that the openings in both the housing structure and lever component are always aligned. As the lever component is rotated within the housing structure, the flow of water is varied. The water flow becomes more restricted as the lever component is rotated from  tab to the other, but is never completely obstructed.
