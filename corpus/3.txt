A golf club teaching and gripping device for properly gripping a golf club without risk of slippage includes a resilient ring dimensioned for receiving at least  fingers on an upper hand of a golfer. The resilient ring has planar inner and outer portions and arcuate upper and lower portions together forming a continuous ring for receiving the fingers of the golfer. Attached to the resilient ring is a golf club gripping portion comprising a generally U-shaped member fabricated of a pliable material. The U-shaped member has an arcuate base portion and a pair of upwardly  and inwardly curving free portions. An outer surface of the arcuate base portion is secured to the planar inner portion of the resilient ring of the finger coupling portion and  between the fingers and a palm of the golfer when the finger coupling portion is in place on the upper hand of the golfer. The  member receives the handle of a golf club between the free portions thereof for securement to the handle and coupling with the upper hand of the golfer.
