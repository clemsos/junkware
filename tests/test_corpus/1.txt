Cystic fibrosis affects  children and young adults in the US alone
 the mists of salt water can reduce the pus and infection that fills the airways of cystic fibrosis sufferers, although side effects include a nasty coughing fit and a harsh taste. 
That's the conclusion of  studies published in this week's issue of The    of  
They found that inhaling a mist with a salt content of  or  improved lung function and, in some cases, produced less absenteeism from school or work. 
Cystic fibrosis, a progressive and frequently fatal genetic disease that affects about  young adults and children in the US alone, is marked by a thickening of the mucus which makes it harder to clear the lungs of debris and bacteria. 
The salt water solution "really opens up a new avenue for approaching patients with cystic fibrosis and how to treat them," says     of the US      and    which sponsored  of the studies. 
  of the     in    and colleagues authored  of the new published studies.
The team found that the  volunteers who regularly inhaled a   mist of salty water had fewer breathing problems and less absenteeism from school or work than those who inhaled a solution with a salt content of under   
"Adding salt [and water] to the airway surfaces of patients with cystic fibrosis is beneficial for both children and adults, they conclude. 
All of the patients first inhaled a chemical to try to open their lung passages as much as possible.
In the second study, US-based     of the  of   at   and his colleagues found that a   salt mist "produced a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function because it helped hydrate the lungs.
In an accompanying editorial,    of the  for  Children in     cited several unpleasant side effects of the salt mist treatment including a bad taste, coughing fits and the lengthy  minutes it can take to administer. 
He added that in the study by  and team, patients may not have received the best long-term antibiotic treatment. 
That would make the inhaled salt water mist appear more effective than it would have been if people were getting a better drug, says   
 says limitations inherent to the treatment mean a salt water mist "may be just a first step in treating cystic fibrosis.

Scientists have rescued a mouse immune system that was overwhelmed by a systemic blood infection. But will this work in humans?
Scientists have discovered how infections that invade the whole body, like malaria, disable the immune system and prevent it from detecting and fighting other microorganisms.
The Australian and German researchers say the discovery may help scientists to develop vaccines that restore immunity in people with systemic or 'whole body' infections. 
They publish their research today online in the journal   
The immune response is alerted when specialised sentries of the immune system, dendritic cells, detect a virus or bacteria.
They alert the immune system by capturing infected cells and displaying fragments or antigens of the pathogen on their surface in a process called cross-presentation.  
Lead researcher     an immunologist from the  and   of   in   says systemic infections such as malaria or sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood, overstimulate dendritic cells.
This results in the immune system's critical alarm system shutting down.
"This doesn't occur in local infections because only a few dendritic cells are involved,"  says.
"But in the case of malaria infections and sepsis, dendritic cells throughout the body are concentrated on alerting the immune system, which prevents them from detecting and responding to any new infections." 
A new type of vaccine?
 and colleagues managed to restore immunity in mice with an immune system compromised by sepsis.
They injected them with a live vaccine made of dendritic cells that had been  to a secondary virus in the laboratory, and subsequently displayed antigens of that virus. 
 says the findings show the missing link in the immunosupressed animal is the capacity of the dendritic cells to display the antigens of new viruses. 
"We should be able to take dendritic cells from a patient with sepsis or malaria and  them to antigens of the virus of a secondary infection and inject them back into the patient.
"This strategy is already being used in the development of anti-cancer vaccines. We are yet to find out if will work against secondary infections in humans with a systemic infection,"  says.

Scientists will analyse the contents of this capsule for clues about how the solar system began
A seven-year quest to return to  pristine samples from the solar system's formation ended in triumph in a dark and wet  desert at the weekend. 
"It's hard to describe what it feels like to be at this point of the mission,"  of  researcher and lead scientist of the Stardust mission    said shortly after the probe's touchdown at      on   
"We travelled almost   miles in space. We visited a comet, grabbed a piece of it and it landed here this morning,"  said. "It's an incredible thrill." 
Stardust released its precious cargo during a high-speed flyby of   sending the tyre-sized canister soaring through space at a blazing speed of about  kilometres per hour when it smashed into the planet's atmosphere.
This makes it the fastest human-made object, topping the record set in   by the returning   command module. 
As its heat-shield fried away, a comet-like plume formed in its wake, looking like a torch that was visible in parts of the western US. 
"We weren't quite sure how bright it was going to be and some people didn't think we would see anything," says   who slipped outside the  base with some of his team members to try to spot the capsule's streak across the sky. 
After scanning the sky for several minutes,  finally found an object that he said looked like   but was clearly not where  was at the time. 
"It was twinkling a little bit, getting a little brighter, and moving. I thought, maybe that's a helicopter. But it kept getting brighter and brighter and brighter," he says. 
The object was reddish in colour and trailed a bright, glowing plume behind it,  says.
"It's ironic, you have a comet mission that ends producing a comet."

During its time in space, Stardust passed by     and  a gel-filled collecting device to trap some particles to take back to   It also collected bits of interstellar dust. 
Scientists believe comets contain unaltered material that was used to form the solar system. 
"We did this mission to collect the most primitive materials we could in the solar system,"  says.
"We went to a comet that formed at the edge of the solar system, far from the  under very cold conditions. We're confident that it was made out of the initial building blocks of our solar system." 
The capsule was retrieved by helicopter crews and taken to a clean room on the   and  Range for inspection.
The canister containing the samples is scheduled to be removed from the capsule and flown to the    in  on   
There, scientists will catalogue the samples and begin distributing them to teams for analysis.

Gotcha! A colourful, striking image can spark your interest
 users can take just  twentieth of a second to decide whether they like the look of a website, new research has found.
"Visual appeal can be assessed within  milliseconds, suggesting that web designers have about  milliseconds to make a good impression," the Canadian researchers report in the  issue of the journal Behaviour &   
   and colleagues from   in  confirm that internet users are a fickle lot.
The team did this by flashing up websites for  milliseconds and asking participants to rate them for visual appeal.
When they repeated the  after a longer viewing period the ratings were consistent.
The medium is the message
The finding comes as bad news to anyone hoping to convey information, says    an Australian researcher who evaluates website useability and senior lecturer in information management at the  of   
"There's no doubt that people do respond very quickly to websites and decide very quickly whether to stay on them," she says.
The appeal of a website is usually tied to colour, movement and interactivity, she says, with the way the information is structured coming second.
 says it's unclear whether the internet is changing our ability to concentrate for long periods our if we are adapting to the medium.
"There's so much information and ... there's always going to be a lot of clicking around just to see what's there," she says.
The halo effect
Australian associate professor of psychology     from the  of     says it takes about  milliseconds to read  word, making this a "stunningly remarkable timeframe in which to process the  stimuli on a website.
"It's quite remarkable that people do it that fast and that it holds up in their later judgement," he says.
"This may be because we have an affective or emotional system that [works] independently of our cognitive system."
In evolutionary terms, this ability helped us respond rapidly to dangerous situations, he says.
The study also reflects the so-called halo effect,   says, where an initial bias towards something drives subsequent judgements.
"This suggests that we make very quick judgements based on some sort of emotional reaction and our more considered judgements still reflect that first impression."

Jewish people's history and migrations are reflected in their   a new study shows
 Jewish mothers who lived  years ago in  are the ancestors of  of all   alive today, international researchers report.
The  study paints a vivid picture of human evolution and survival, and correlates with the well-established written and oral histories of Jewish migrations, says    of the   of   who worked on the study. 
The study, published in the   of    suggests that some  5   alive today descended from  women. 
For their study,  and scientists from  and the US sampled  from  people from  populations.
"All subjects reported the birthplace of their mothers, grandmothers, and, in most cases, great-grandmothers," the scientists write. 
They looked at mitochondrial   which is found in cells, outside the nucleus and away from the  that carries most genetic instructions.
  is passed down virtually unchanged from mother to daughter, but it does occasionally mutate, at a known rate. 
Researchers can use this molecular clock to track genetic changes through time.
They used it, for instance, to compute when the "ancestral   of all living humans lived: in   about  years ago. 
Now they have found  ancestral Jewish mothers. 
"I think there was some kind of genetic pool that was in the Near  "  says.
"Among this genetic pool there were  maternal lineages,  real women, that carried the  specific mitochondrial  markers that we can find in mitochondrial  today." 
  They, or their direct descendants, moved into   
"Then at a certain period, most probably in the    OF
